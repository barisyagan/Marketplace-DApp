## Design Pattern Decisions
#### Fail Early and Fail Loud
All of the condition checkings in functions are made as early as possible via modifiers or inline checking before function body which guarantees failing early. Also every condition check is made with require keyword which guarantees failing loudly. All of these reduce unnecessary code execution. 
#### Restricting Access

#### Pull over Push Payments
#### Circuit Braker
